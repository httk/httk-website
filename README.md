# httk web pages

The httk website and subpages are for technical reasons not managed here (this repo is empty) but instead under a separate GitHub organization [httk-web](https://github.com/httk-web).

This allows the use of sub-pages under http://httk.org/ with the same name as repositories in the main httk organization without having to actually serve them from the same repo, but instead from a separare website-specific repo. The website-specific repo then goes in the httk-web organization, whereas the code repo goes in httk organization.
